1. Storing values at their indices.
2. In case of negative, store it with negative sign and while traversing obtain the absolute for index. (or move negative
    to either front or last and then proceed).
3. For a range of queries on indexes, perform the operation on start index, and perform the opposite on endIndex+1, then
    prefetch will build the array.
4. UnionFind.
5. Shortest Distance is BFS.(first encountered)
6. In Case of trees, if we want to return 2 values, return it as LinkedList.
7. In case of circular traversal, we can obtain as idx = i % totalLength. Some example, find the immediate greater
    element on right side in circular array.
8.
