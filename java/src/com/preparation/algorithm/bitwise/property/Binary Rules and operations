Property:

1. Binary xor --> for same values it will result in 0 else 1. i.e. 0 ^ 0 = 0 , 1 ^ 1 = 1
2. Binary subtraction --> 0-1 = 1(borrow from left side), 1-0 = 0 , 1-1=0
    Also, Binary subtraction is arithmetic, means if we are subtracting 10-3 = 7. in binary so we can directly do that also.

3. If we subtract a number x and x-1 it will result in all 1's after the rightmost one.
    The property is, the difference between a binary number n and n-1 is all the bits on the right of the rightmost 1 are flipped including the rightmost 1
    Example:
    1000 – 0001 = 0111  --> after the right most one which in this case is at the 4th digit, all has turned one and the rightmost in to 0. i.e. flipped

    0100 – 0001 = 0011 --> same

    1100 – 0001 = 1011

4. So using above property if you want to find the rightmost set bit.
    then
    x & ~(x-1) --> will always give the rightmost set bit only with all other as 0.

    How this works?
    Let’s dig little deep to see how this expression will work.
    We know that N & ~N = 0
    If we subtract 1 from the number, it will be subtracted from the right most set bit and that bit will be become 0.
    So if we negate the remaining number from step above then that bit will become 1.
    Now N & ~(N-1) will make all the bits 0 but the right most set bit of a number.

6. Using aboveproperty you can find if an element has this bit as set or not set. by performin and and with above result
    element & set_bit_from_above_number

    ( If you have a CS background and understood whatever i have said up till now, then congrats!
     You now already know 80% about a powerful data structure called Fenwick Tree or Binary Indexed Tree. )
