 * <p>
 * Find the bitonic point in the given array, i.e the maximum element in the given bitonic array. This can be done in log(n) time by modifying the binary search algorithm. You can refer to this post on how to do this.
 * If the element to be searched is equal to the element at the bitonic point then print the index of the bitonic point.
 * If the element to be searched is greater than the element at a bitonic point then the element does not exist in the array.
 * If the element to be searched is less than the element at a bitonic point then search for the element in both halves of the array using binary search.
