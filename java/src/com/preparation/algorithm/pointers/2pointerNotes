Questions like:
1. Sum of pair with k in sorted array. (Pair sum)
    We can also use Hashmap here, with complement(i.e. if k-element) exist , pair exist.

2. 3 element pair sum
    https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/
    can be solved by traversing elements and for each element apply the algot to find a pair
    with sum k, where k=complement of current element.
    o(n^2)

    Also,
    using HashMap can be solved but again o(n^2)
