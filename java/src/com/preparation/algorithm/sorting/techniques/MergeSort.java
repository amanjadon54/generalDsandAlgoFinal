/**
 * Divide and conquer(merge)
 *
 * In merge sort,
 *      worst case and average case has same complexities O(n log n).
 *      Space complexity : o(N) for merge operation.
 *
 * Efficiency:
 * Merge sort is more efficient and works faster than quick sort in case of larger array size or datasets.
 * whereas
 *
 * Quick sort is more efficient and works faster than merge sort in case of smaller array size or datasets.
 * Sorting method :
 *
 * The quick sort is internal sorting method where the data is sorted in main memory.
 * whereas
 * The merge sort is external sorting method in which the data that is to be sorted cannot be accommodated in the memory and needed auxiliary memory for sorting.
 *
 * Preferred for :
 * Quick sort is preferred for arrays.
 * whereas
 * Merge sort is preferred for linked lists.
