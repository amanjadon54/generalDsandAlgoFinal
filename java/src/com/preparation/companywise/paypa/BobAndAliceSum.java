/**
 * Problem Statement:
 * <p>
 * A Subarray means the part of the array formed by removing zero or more elements from either side of the array. A Subarray is represented as [X,Y] that means it contains the elements, A[X], A[X+1]......A[Y]
 * <p>
 * There is an Array of size N and given K subarrays. Alice and Bob are asked to find the sum of all the sums obtained from each subarray. Alice works on the given array itself where as Bob wanted to rearrange the array optimally such as the given subarrays would maximise the sum.
 * <p>
 * Find the difference between sums of Bob and Alice.
 * <p>
 * Input:
 * <p>
 * T => no of test cases
 * N, K =>size of array and number of subarrays
 * N integers denoting the array
 * K lines each containing the boundaries of the subarray.
 * Output:
 * <p>
 * Difference between Sum of Bob and Alice
 * Limits:
 * 1<T<=10
 * 0<N,K<=10^5
 * 0<A[i]<=10^5
 * <p>
 * Sample Input:
 * 2
 * 4,3
 * 1,9,1,6
 * 1,1
 * 1,2
 * 1,3
 * 6,7
 * 2,3,5,6,2,6
 * 1,2
 * 1,5
 * 2,6
 * 6,6
 * 5,5
 * 5,5
 * 3,5
 * <p>
 * Output:
 * 5
 * 13
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * NOTE: queries in the test cases are 1-Indexed

public class BobAndAliceSum {

    //Approach:
    //for alice obtain the prefetch sum and using that obtain the result of any range by subtracting arr[start-1] prefetch
    //and arr[end+1]

    //for bob
    //Obtain the frequency of most visited indexes as HashMap<index,Count>.
    //At max indexes place the larger elements and keep continue doing that
    //once you have the final array in place
    //obtain the sum using alice prefetch logic only.
