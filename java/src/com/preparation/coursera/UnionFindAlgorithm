A set of algorithms for solving the so-called dynamic connectivity
1. QuickFind
2. QuickUnion
3. WightedQuickUnion
4. WeightedQuickUnion with path compression


Lecture: Union−Find. We illustrate our basic approach to developing and analyzing algorithms by considering the dynamic
        connectivity problem. We introduce the union–find data type and consider several implementations
         (quick find, quick union, weighted quick union, and weighted quick union with path compression).
         Finally, we apply the union–find data type to the percolation problem from physical chemistry.
