 * Rotate a Linked List
 * Last Updated: 26-07-2020
 * Given a singly linked list, rotate the linked list counter-clockwise by k nodes. Where k is a given positive integer.
 * For example, if the given linked list is 10->20->30->40->50->60 and k is 4, the list should be modified to 50->60->10->20->30->40. Assume that k is smaller than the count of nodes in linked list.
