For Path Finding: (we can use BFS,DFS, or Dijkstra)

Dijkstra = BFS + priorityQueue over normal Queue.

1. if path has weights, then Dijkstra is preferred (though can be solved using BFS also)
2. If path has -ve weights also, simple backtracking + dp is preferred called as bellman ford
    The Bellman-Ford is pretty much the same as the DP approach except that it is more space-optimized.
    The Bellmanâ€“Ford algorithm is an algorithm that computes shortest paths from a single source vertex to all of the other vertices
    in a weighted digraph. It is slower than Dijkstra's algorithm for the same problem, but more versatile, as it is capable of handling graphs
    in which some of the edge weights are negative numbers.
3. If weight are constant for each path use any from BFS,DFS.



Probs:
1. Find min/max , always an issue.
2. count is fine.
