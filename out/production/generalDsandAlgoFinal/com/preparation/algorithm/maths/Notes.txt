1. Find the smallest missing sum which cant be computed from the elements sum(used in any manner)
    1,2,3,6  --> 13

    1,2,5,6 --> 4

    Hint: idea is to keep computing the prefix sum and check whether prefixSum+1 < nextElement
            if(yes)
                then prefixSum+1 is the ans


2. Convert a repeated sequence in the following manner.
    10.3 --> 3.3333..  --> 3.(3)
    Constraint: cant store the result in float/double at all.
    Idea: to understand if a number is repeated, dont go for divide and then search in string
          Instead, use the concept of remainder, meaning if the remainder has occured before
          which means it will now repeat.
