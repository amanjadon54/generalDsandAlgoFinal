/**
 * Partition a set into two subsets such that the difference of subset sums is minimum
 * <p>
 * Given a set of integers, the task is to divide it into two sets S1 and S2 such that the absolute difference between their sums is minimum.
 * <p>
 * If there is a set S with n elements, then if we assume Subset1 has m elements, Subset2 must have n-m elements and the value of abs(sum(Subset1) â€“ sum(Subset2)) should be minimum.
 * <p>
 * Example:
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Input:  arr[] = {1, 6, 11, 5}
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation:
 * Subset1 = {1, 5, 6}, sum of Subset1 = 12
 * Subset2 = {11}, sum of Subset2 = 11
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Approach:
 * In basic, if we go thoroughly, we need 2 subsets s1,s2 such that abs(s1-s2)=min; unlike equal partition where s1-s2=0
 * so if can figure out the sum of one subset lets say s1, we can calculate the other subset sum by totalSum-s1;
 * hence abs(s1 - (total-s1)) = min;
 * So question boils down to find the nearest subset sum to k. (which would in this case will give s1 to us and rest we can calculate.)
 * <p>
 * Note: nearest sum to k , cz 2 subset will have min sum if the subset sum is nearest to each other.
