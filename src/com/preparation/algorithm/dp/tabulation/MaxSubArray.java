/**
 * can be done in o(n) using Kandane technique discussed in subarrays algos.
 * <p>
 * Another approach:
 * Dp with tabulation. (is what we were doing in kandane)
 * <p>
 * Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.
 * <p>
 * Example:
 * <p>
 * Input: [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4],
 * Output: 6
 * Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.
