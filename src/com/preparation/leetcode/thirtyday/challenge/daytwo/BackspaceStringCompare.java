/**
 * Given two strings S and T, return if they are equal when both are typed into empty text editors. # means a backspace character.
 * <p>
 * Note that after backspacing an empty text, the text will continue empty.
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Input: S = "ab#c", T = "ad#c"
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: Both S and T become "ac".
 * Example 2:
 * <p>
 * Input: S = "ab##", T = "c#d#"
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: Both S and T become "".
 * Example 3:
 * <p>
 * Input: S = "a##c", T = "#a#c"
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: Both S and T become "c".
 * Example 4:
 * <p>
 * Input: S = "a#c", T = "b"
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: S becomes "c" while T becomes "b".
 * Note:
 * <p>
 * 1 <= S.length <= 200
 * 1 <= T.length <= 200
 * S and T only contain lowercase letters and '#' characters.
 * Follow up:
 * <p>
 * Can you solve it in O(N) time and O(1) space?
